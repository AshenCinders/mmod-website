/**
 * List of SVG icons to bundle, as strings. We use icons from 3 sources:
 * 1. Material Design Icons [mdi] (https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/)
 *    For general purpose icons.
 * 2. Simple Icons [si] (https://simpleicons.org/)
 *    For brands.
 * 3. Custom made [mom]
 *    Anything unique to Momentum. Usually made by Traz or Tom, feel free
 *    to reach out to us if you need anything specific.
 *
 * Any icons used within the Angular application *must* be exported here so
 * it gets bundled properly. An Angular directive will yell at you if you don't.
